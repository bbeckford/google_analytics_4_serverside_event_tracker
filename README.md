# Google Analytics 4 Serverside Event Tracker
A PHP server-side event tracking class for sending events to Google Analytics 4 from the backend of your app.

Adding to GitHub in the hopes that others can help me continue the effort of reverse-engineering all the parameters we could send to Google Analytics 4, contributions welcome :)

# Google Analytics 4 Serverside Event Tracker
A PHP server-side event tracking class for sending events to Google Analytics 4 from the backend of your app.

Adding to GitHub in the hopes that others can help me continue the effort of reverse-engineering all the parameters we could send to Google Analytics 4, contributions welcome :)

Current status: it works! But I don't know what all the parameters mean yet.
Also it needs the ability to add custom parameters to the events now as we aren't just confined to category/action/label/value like before with Universal Analytics.
